convert from build123d to fusion 360 api python script.

- Observe symmetry
- All 2D and 3D objects in build123d have an align property that defaults to (Align.CENTER, Align.CENTER, Align.CENTER)
   An alignment of Align.MIN in the X direction means that the 2d or 3d shape's leftmost boundary should be at the origin
- the following fusion 360 api functions are deprecated setAllExtent, setDistanceExtent, setOneSideToExtent, setTwoSidesDistanceExtent, setTwoSidesToExtent
- use a helper function to convert from build123d native units to fusion 360 native units
- do not create new component use the default one
- copy parameters, radius and diameters, and computed parameters verbatim into the top of the fusion 360 script(directly after the imports).  
- In final messagebox, instead of printing dimensions, 
  in build123d you will find the volume of the part as a comment on the last line. do not calculate build123d volume.
  you will need to calculate the fusion 360 volume.
  print both the volume as build123 thinks it is and the calculated fusion360 volume(you can assume the first body always).   
  Print a statement that indicates if volumes are identical or not.
- the resulting fusion360 script should be using python typing wherever possible.

The input I am providing is a series of build123 files concatenated. 
I want you to convert them to functions(snake case, remove non-alphanumeric chars), then
call them from run function. 
For each file, I want to create a new component and pass that component to the function.
If the volumes are identical, do not display anything, only if volumes are different.
Inside the end of each function, I need to close the fusion360.
