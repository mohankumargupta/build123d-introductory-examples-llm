- take python program and put imports inside each example 


Take this input snippet:

from build123d import *


##########################################
# 1. Simple Rectangular Plate

length = 80.0
width = 60.0
thickness = 10.0

with BuildPart() as ex1:
    Box(length, width, thickness)


##########################################
# 2. Plane with Hole

length = 80.0
width = 60.0
thickness = 10.0
center_hole_dia = 22.0

with BuildPart() as ex2:
    Box(length, width, thickness)
    Cylinder(radius=center_hole_dia / 2, height=thickness, mode=Mode.SUBTRACT)

Produce output snippet like:



##########################################
# 1. Simple Rectangular Plate

from build123d import *

length = 80.0
width = 60.0
thickness = 10.0

with BuildPart() as ex1:
    Box(length, width, thickness)

part = ex1.part

##########################################
# 2. Plane with Hole

from build123d import *

length = 80.0
width = 60.0
thickness = 10.0
center_hole_dia = 22.0

with BuildPart() as ex2:
    Box(length, width, thickness)
    Cylinder(radius=center_hole_dia / 2, height=thickness, mode=Mode.SUBTRACT)

part = ex2.part

I want you to notice the modifications made:
- removed the import on the first line
- for each example added import underneath the comment line
- added a final line part=[variable].part where variable is to be replaced with same name as on the BuildPart
