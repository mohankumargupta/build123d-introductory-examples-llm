Create a python program. It takes a python source code as input(from a file). The file contains a list of examples like below:

##########################################
# 1. Simple Rectangular Plate

from build123d import *

length = 80.0
width = 60.0
thickness = 10.0

with BuildPart() as ex1:
    Box(length, width, thickness)

part = ex1.part




First, create an examples folder if it does not exist.
For each example: 
  - Create a file, in this example 01-Simple-Rectangular-Plate.py
  - put contents of the file
Do this for each example you find
