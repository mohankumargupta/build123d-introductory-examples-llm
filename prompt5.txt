Create a python program. It takes a python source code as input(from a file, by default general_examples5.py). The file contains a list of examples like below:
Use pathlib.

##########################################
# 1. Simple Rectangular Plate

from build123d import *

length = 80.0
width = 60.0
thickness = 10.0

with BuildPart() as ex1:
  Box(length, width, thickness)

part = ex1.part



First, create an examples folder if it does not exist.
If it does exist, remove it then create the folder.

For each example: 
  - Create a file, in this example example-01.py
  - put contents of the file, including comments.
Do this for each example you find
