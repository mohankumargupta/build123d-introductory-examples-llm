Python program.
Use pathlib.
Takes 2 arguments, input directory and output directory.
Create output directory if it doesn't exist.
If it does exist, remove it.s
The program looks for python files in the input directory, 
and for each one produces the same filename in the output directory.

For each file: eg if this was the file:

```python
from build123d import *

length = 80.0
width = 60.0
thickness = 10.0

with BuildPart() as ex1:
  Box(length, width, thickness)

part = ex1.part
```

Then I want you to do the following for each file you find in input directory:
- Copy the file to output directory but add a "_temp" to the filename stem.
- Another copy of file to to output directory but keep the original file name
- For the file with filename stem "_temp", append the following line then run the python code:
   print(part.volume)
- Capture the output say in a variable called captured_output
- Now with the copy in the output directory I want you to modify the file so that it looks like:
- delte the file with filename stem "_temp"


```python
from build123d import *

length = 80.0
width = 60.0
thickness = 10.0

with BuildPart() as ex1:
    Box(length, width, thickness)

part = ex1.part
# Volume: 48000 mm^3
```
