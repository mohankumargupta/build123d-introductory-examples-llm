convert from build123d to fusion 360 api python script.

- Observe symmetry
- All 2D and 3D objects in build123d have an align property that defaults to (Align.CENTER, Align.CENTER, Align.CENTER)
   An alignment of Align.MIN in the X direction means that the 2d or 3d shape's leftmost boundary should be at the origin
- the following fusion 360 api functions are deprecated setAllExtent, setDistanceExtent, setOneSideToExtent, setTwoSidesDistanceExtent, setTwoSidesToExtent
- use a helper function to convert from build123d native units to fusion 360 native units
- do not create new component use the default one
- copy parameters, radius and diameters, and computed parameters verbatim into the top of the fusion 360 script(directly after the imports).  
- In final messagebox, instead of printing dimensions, 
  in build123d you will find the volume of the part as a comment on the last line. do not calculate build123d volume.
  print both the volume as build123 thinks it is and the calculated fusion360 volume(you can assume the first body always).   
  Print a statement that indicates if volumes are identical or not.
